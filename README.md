# GamblersFallacyPy

Python file that runs a simulation of the gamblers fallacy or
the Monte Carlo fallacy.

The "Gambler" in this case decides that he can remember the past
10 throws of a fair coin. He naively decides that if he's seen
more tails in the previous six throws then its more likely that
a head will occur next. If there's been an even number of heads
and tails then he decides randomly, and if there's been more
heads than tails, he will vote tails.
